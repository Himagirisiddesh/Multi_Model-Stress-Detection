🧠 Emotion Detection AI

An AI-powered system that detects human emotions in real-time using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning techniques**. This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze facial expressions and classify emotions accurately.

📌 Overview

Understanding human emotions is a crucial aspect of Human-Computer Interaction. This project aims to build a real-time emotion detection system that can identify facial expressions through a webcam feed.

The model is trained on labeled facial expression datasets and can classify emotions such as:

1. 😄 Happy
2. 😢 Sad
3. 😡 Angry
4. 😲 Surprise
5. 😐 Neutral
6. 😱 Fear
7. 🤢 Disgust

🚀 Features

* 🎥 Real-time emotion detection via webcam
* 🧠 Deep learning-based classification (CNN)
* 👁️ Face detection using Haar Cascade (OpenCV)
* ⚡ Fast and efficient prediction pipeline
* 🖥️ Easy-to-run Python application
